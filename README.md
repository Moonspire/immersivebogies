Immersive Bogies is a small addon to MTS and IR that aims to make a new type of MTS vehicle that can operate on IR rails.

Immersive Bogies requires some modifications to MTS in its current form. In order to contribute you will need to compile MTS from [my fork](https://github.com/Moonspire/TransportSimulatorFork) and then import it to the project via ./libs

This is currently ONLY for 1.12.2
